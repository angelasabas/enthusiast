
Enthusiast 3.x - Installation/Configuration
-------------------------------------------

===========================================



Enthusiast 3 is fully customizable collective and listing script rolled into
one. It is highly different from current scripts, so please read this file
in its entirety to know how to install, configure and use Enthusiast 3 to
manage your collective and fanlistings.

Usage of Enthusiast 3 is primarily centered around including script snippets
into pages you create for your collective and fanlisting; thus, there is no
joined.php, owned.php, or affiliates.php files (for the collective part) and
no join.php, member.php, update.php (et al) files (for the fanlisting part).
Making these show up on your collective and fanlisting is through the use of
the snippets, which are explained below.



IMPORTANT TIPS AND HINTS
------------------------

1. This install.txt file attempts to fully explain the whole installation
   process, both for installing Enthusiast 3 (the collective script) and using
   the installed Enthusiast 3 for your fanlistings. ENTHUSIAST 3 IS VERY
   DIFFERENT FROM CURRENT SCRIPTS, so reading the texts in their entirety IS A
   MUST. Trust me, it will help!!

2. Once Enthusiast 3 is installed and you are inside the admin panel, before
   you change anything, you must read through whatever instructions and hints
   and tips I leave on the page. I try to provide instructions liberally,
   and if you think a certain thing should be explained more, please feel free
   to suggest it to me.

3. Before converting listings over from Enthusiast 2 or phpFanbase or using
   any other convert script, BACKUP YOUR DATABASES. You can do this using
   third-party scripts such as phpMyAdmin and the like.

4. Before converting listings over from Enthusiast 2 or phpFanbase or using
   any other convert script, READ ALL INSTRUCTIONS.

5. Five is my lucky number, so I'll reiterate it one more time: READ ALL OF
   THE PROVIDED DOCUMENTATION BEFORE DOING ANYTHING AND AGAIN BEFORE ASKING
   QUESTIONS.



Main Installation
-----------------

1. Unzip the enth3 zip file and open enth3/config.sample.php in a text editor
   and change the database variables to reflect the database and tables you
   will use for Enthusiast 3. Please keep in mind that this will be the
   settings for your collective, NOT a single fanlisting. Save this as
   config.php.

2. Copy all the files in the enth3/ folder of the zip file into a folder in
   your website. Please note that this folder is for your ENTH3 INSTALLATION,
   NOT YOUR FANLISTING; this is the folder for the admin panel of Enth3.

3. Go to install.php in your browser, i.e., if you uploaded the enth3/ files
   to http://yourdomain.com/admin, go to
   http://yourdomain.com/admin/install.php

4. Fill out all the fields in the form and click "Install Enthusiast 3!"
   Please note that TRAILING SLASHES ARE IMPORTANT. They are VERY important
   for Enth3-- the lack of trailing slashes can lead to a lot of errors
   throughout the script. So please ADD TRAILING SLASHES TO ALL URLS AND PATHS.
   Optional: when the script has finished, you can either go on and log into
   Enth3 using the index.php page or install the categories in The Fanlistings
   Network (and optionally also the categories for The Anime Fanlistings
   Network) by going on to install_cats.php.
   Additionally, remember to CHMOD your joined, owned, and affiliates
   directories to 755.

5. Log into Enth3 by going to index.php :)



Collective Configuration
------------------------

1. Open the config.sample.php file that is *outside* the enth3/ directory in
   the zip file, and supply the proper database values. Do not edit anything
   else. Save this as config.php.

   The database and sendmail values for this config file should MIRROR (read:
   is exactly the same) as the config file found in your Enth3 installation.
   The only difference, if ever, would be the database server IF the fanlisting
   is hosted on another server.

2. Upload this file to the directory that you want your collective site to
   be in. This is not the admin panel; the admin panel and the collective site
   directory must naturally be different from each other.

3. To show the Joined Listings, insert the PHP lines below into the PHP file
   where you want your joined listings to show up (make sure the extension
   is .php or this will not work):

      <?php include 'config.php';
      $show_list = false;
      include ENTH_PATH . 'show_joined.php'; ?>

   Setting $show_list to true will show a bulletted list instead of a
   dropdown menu for selecting the category.

3. To show the Owned Listings, insert the PHP line below into the PHP file
   where you want your owned listings to show up (make sure the extension
   is .php or this will not work):

      <?php include 'config.php';
      $status = 'STATUS';
      $hide_dropdown = false;
      $show_list = false;
      $show = 'SHOW';
      include ENTH_PATH . 'show_owned.php'; ?>

   where STATUS would be either of the following:

      pending   = for pending listings
      upcoming  = for upcoming listings
      current   = for current listings

   and SHOW would be the category ID of the "default" category to see if no
   category is selected by the visitor from the dropdown menu, or 'all'.
   The variables $hide_dropdown, $show_list, and $show are completely optional
   variables (these lines can be removed). Setting $hide_dropdown to true
   will not give the visitor any way to select a category; setting $show_list
   to true will show a bulletted list instead of a dropdown menu for selecting
   the category; if a category ID is set for $show, that category will be
   pre-selected for default viewing.

   For example:

   If you just simply want to show the dropdown on your current listings page
   with the default settings, you insert:

      <?php include 'config.php';
      $status = 'current';
      include ENTH_PATH . 'show_owned.php'; ?>

   But, for example you wish to show your upcoming listings without the
   dropdown but want every upcoming listing to show up as soon as the page
   loads (meaning, the user does not have to select anything), you would
   insert:

      <?php include 'config.php';
      $status = 'upcoming';
      $hide_dropdown = true;
      $show = 'all';
      include ENTH_PATH . 'show_owned.php'; ?>

   Lastly, if you want to use a bulletted list but pre-select a category for
   the user to view, you would insert:

      <?php include 'config.php';
      $status = 'current';
      $show_list = true;
      $show = '1';
      include ENTH_PATH . 'show_owned.php'; ?>

4. To show the collective affiliates, insert the PHP line below into the PHP
   file where you want your collective affiliates to show up (make sure the
   extension is .php or this will not work):

      <?php include 'config.php';
      include ENTH_PATH . 'show_collective_affiliates.php'; ?>



Collective Statistics
---------------------

1. Open up in a text editor the page where you want your collective stats
   to show up, and insert this line before wherever you want the stats to
   be placed:

      <?php
      include 'config.php';
      include ENTH_PATH . 'show_collective_stats.php';
      ?>

2. The instructions below are all optional, depending on what information you
   want to show on your collective. The PHP snippets below will all show plain
   numbers unless otherwise specified.

   Tip: if you want to have the numbers show up in comma notation, you can
   use the following PHP function:

      <?php echo number_format( $variable ) ?>

   If you wish to show the total number of categories registered in your
   collective (regardless whether or not you have joined/owned listings
   under it), insert this line onto your page:

      <?php echo $total_cats ?>

   If you wish to show the total number of members for your listings,
   approved only:

      <?php echo $collective_total_fans_approved ?>

   If you wish to show the total number of members for your listings,
   pending only:

      <?php echo $collective_total_fans_pending ?>

   If you wish to show the growth rate of your owned listings (i.e., the
   rate at which you open/get approved for fanlistings):

      <?php echo $owned_growth_rate ?>

   If you wish to show the cumulative growth rate of your individual listings
   (i.e., the rate at which your listings get members):

      <?php echo $collective_fans_growth_rate ?>

   If you wish to show the rate at which you join listings:

      <?php echo $joined_growth_rate ?>

   If you wish to show the newest owned listing in your collective (current
   only), insert these lines on your page, depending on what you want to
   show:

      <?php echo $owned_newest['title'] ?>       - listing title
      <?php echo $owned_newest['subject'] ?>     - listing subject
      <?php echo $owned_newest['url'] ?>         - listing URL
      <?php echo $owned_newest['desc'] ?>        - listing description

      <?php echo $joined_newest['imagefile'] ?>   - listing image (directory path
                                               not included)
     
   If you wish to show a random owned listing in your collective (current

Fanlisting Configuration
------------------------

1. Go to setup.php in your Enth3 installation (you can access this via the
   Owned section) and install the fanlisting (follow instructions on the page).
   Take note of the Listing ID that is assigned to it upon creation.

2. Open the config.sample.php file that is *outside* the enth3/ directory in
   the zip file, and supply the proper database values. Uncomment the line that
   says "$listing = 1;" by deleting the two slashes before the line (hence,
   from the line that says

      //$listing = 1;

   it should now look like

      $listing = 1;

   and change the value of $listing to the listing ID assigned to the listing
   in Step 1. Save this as config.php.

2. Upload this file (config.php, with the UNCOMMENTED $listing line) to the
   directory that you want your fanlisting site to be in. This is the
   fanlisting directory, NOT the collective directory, and NOT the admin
   panel directory.

   IMPORTANT NOTE: Folders for your listings do NOT have to be inside the admin
   folder. They can be virtually anywhere.

3. To show the members list, insert the PHP lines below into the PHP file
   where you want the list to show up (make sure the extension
   is .php or this will not work):

      <?php include 'config.php';
      include ENTH_PATH . 'show_sort.php';
      include ENTH_PATH . 'show_members.php'; ?>

   Optional: when sorting members either by country or an additional field,
   the value of the sort field (i.e., for sorting by country, the value
   "United States") will be stripped from the members template. Therefore,
   if you have your fans listed as "Jane from United States", viewing them all
   will show the proper phrase, but sorting by country will yield "Jane from"
   only. To prevent this, use these lines instead:

      <?php include 'config.php';
      include ENTH_PATH . 'show_sort.php';
      $show_sort_field = true;
      include ENTH_PATH . 'show_members.php'; ?>

   By default (as of Enthusiast 3.1), all members that fall under the visitor's
   selected sorting criteria is shown -- which also means that if the visitor
   did not select a sorting criteria, the list automatically shows ALL members
   (paginated, of course). If you have multiple sorting fields selected, i.e.,
   you're sorting first by "country", then by "name", when the visitor first
   enters the members list, he will get all members. If he sorts by country,
   i.e., all from the United States, he will get all members from the US,
   regardless of name. When he then sorts again by name like "Jane", he 
   will get all members from the US named Jane.

   If you wish to turn off this functionality -- meaning, visitors must select
   options from every sorting level before being presented with a members 
   list -- you can add the following line in your snippet, just after 
   including the config.php file:

      $hide_members_until_final = true;

   Of course, you may also choose not to sort your members list at all, and
   in that case you may add this line (make sure $hide_members_until_final
   is not in the snippet!):

      $no_sort = true;

   It is also possible to separate the sorting list and the members list
   (i.e., you want to show the countries list as a bulletted list, but doing
   so will make the members page too long, so you want the countries list on
   one page and the members list on another). To do this, create a file, for
   example countries.php, and insert the PHP lines below into the PHP file
   where you want the countries list to show up (make sure the extension is
   .php or this will not work):

      <?php include 'config.php';
      include ENTH_PATH . 'show_sort.php'; ?>

   And then create another file, for example members.php, and insert the PHP
   lines below into the PHP file where you want the members list to show up
   (make sure the extension is .php or this will not work):

      <?php include 'config.php';
      include ENTH_PATH . 'show_members.php'; ?>

   After that, make sure that the value of the list page in the Enth3 admin
   panel for that listing is set to members.php, NOT countries.php.

4. To show the join form, insert the PHP lines below into the PHP file
   where you want the form to show up (make sure the extension
   is .php or this will not work):
      <?php include 'config.php';
      include ENTH_PATH . 'show_join.php'; ?>

5. To show the update form, insert the PHP lines below into the PHP file
   where you want the form to show up (make sure the extension
   is .php or this will not work):
      <?php include 'config.php';
      include ENTH_PATH . 'show_update.php'; ?>

6. To show the lost password form, insert the PHP lines below into the PHP file
   where you want the form to show up (make sure the extension
   is .php or this will not work):
      <?php include 'config.php';
      include ENTH_PATH . 'show_lostpass.php'; ?>

7. To show the listing statistics, insert the PHP lines below into the PHP file
   where you want the stats to show up (make sure the extension
   is .php or this will not work):
      <?php include 'config.php';
      include ENTH_PATH . 'show_stats.php'; ?>

8. To show the listing affiliates, insert the PHP lines below into the PHP file
   where you want the stats to show up (make sure the extension
   is .php or this will not work):
      <?php include 'config.php';
      include ENTH_PATH . 'show_affiliates.php'; ?>
