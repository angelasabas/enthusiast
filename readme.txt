[[IMPORTANT NOTE]] ---------------------------------------------------------

This is now an unsupported script. There is a version of this script
updated for the latest PHP version at
https://gitlab.com/tfl-php-scripts/enthusiast
-- please use that instead if you must use this script or need to
update your installation.

I'm sorry for ending development on Enthusiast. Perhaps one day.
